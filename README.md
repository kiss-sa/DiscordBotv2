# DiscordBotv2

This is Version two of the infamous Ulrich Bot. He can't do much yet, but he will learn and grow. 

On the timeline there are currently the following features:
- [ ] add `/spark` command back
- [ ] integrate NatStat functionality (i.e. register Players, commandd to change Natstat of a player, view Natstat, add sneery commentary)
